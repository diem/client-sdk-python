  title: Mini Wallet API Specification
  description: >
      **MiniWallet API** is designed as a minimum wallet application API
      for testing a wallet application by playing as counterparty wallet application.
      An implementation of **MiniWallet API** are free to add any new API for its
      own purpose.


      **MiniWallet Test Suite** is a set of tests built on top of **MiniWallet API**
      for validating a wallet application Diem Payment Network integration.


      To enable **MiniWallet Test Suite** for your wallet application, you need create
      a MiniWallet API proxy to your wallet application with the following endpoints:

        * [Create account endpoint](#post-/accounts): required for isolating test data.
        * [Get account balances endpoint](#get-/accounts/-account_id-/balances): required for verifying test results.
        * [Generate payment URI endpoint](#post-/accounts/-account_id-/payment_uris): required for test receiving payment.
        * [Send payment endpoint](#post-/accounts/-account_id-/payments): required for test sending payment.
        * [Get KYC sample endpoint](#get-/kyc_sample): required for test sending payment equal / above travel rule threshold limit.

      You can selectively implement endpoints for testing sub-set features. For example,
      [get KYC sample endpoint](#get-/kyc_sample) is not required until you need test
      payment that triggers travel rule.


      The **MiniWallet Test Suite** also provides tests to verify teh **MiniWallet API** built
      for your application is meeting requirements for running payment integration tests.


      We will improve and grow **MiniWallet Test Suite** to cover more cases.

          * When the account is required to provide KYC data during off-chain KYC exchange process,
            server should use `kyc_data` property value as KycDataObject and send to counterparty service.
          * Server should not raise error for the case `kyc_data` property value is valid but
            it does not meet its business criterias.
          * `balances` property values are the initial deposit to the account.
          * Client should call [get account balances endpoint](#get-/accounts/-account_id-/balances)
            to check account balances after the account is created.
          * Client should store the response account id for all
            the operations to the account.
          * MiniWallet Test Suite isolates test data by creating new account for
            each test case.
